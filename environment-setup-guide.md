# Environment Setup Guide

The following softwares should be installed in order to facilitate the projects and activities that you will be working on during training. It is important to have these installed as soon as possible in order to make sure you're ready to go since training is very fast paced. Please follow the installation videos that I have recorded to get the technologies installed (NOTE: I am using a Windows computer, so if you're on Mac or Linux, you will need to figure out how to install these independently)

* Git
